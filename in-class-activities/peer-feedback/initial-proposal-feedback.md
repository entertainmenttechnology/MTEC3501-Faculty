# Initial Proposal Feedback

_By Allison Berkoy._

_Note: These are two peer feedback activities for initital proposal development (before panel review). The first activity was used in session 4 while proposals were in progress, and the second activity was used in session 5 after full first drafts had been developed. Both of these activities worked well over Zoom._

_While I worried that the Google doc edit activity might be a bit much for the students, in both cohorts this activity went well. Students pointed to this activity as one of the most helpful for receiving strong peer feedback, and it also gave them practice with the pomodoro technique, which a handful of students reporting continuing with outside of class for their work._
  


## Set-up

Introduce (or re-introduce) the [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l4w7uHdNaQ). Discuss how timers for focused work blocks, combined with breaks, can be strategically used and modified. Breaks will be most effective if it includes a break from devices (otherwise it is not really a break but task switching). Our feedback sessions will mirror the Pomodoro Technique. 

## Initial "Professor" Proposal Review
* Students form groups of 4.
* Set 20-25 minute timer for each student's proposal.
  * 10 minutes: Student reviewers read through proposal and jot down questions / notes.
  * 10-15 minutes: Reviewers then play the role of "professor." Ask tough questions, identify concerns, indentify anything unclear, and identify strengths of the proposal. 
* 5 minute break:
    * Reviewers take a 5 minute break / prepare for next round. 
    * Student who was just reviewed, jot down further notes.
* Continue additional rounds until all students in the group have been reviewed. After 4 rounds, take a longer break. 
* As a group, discuss process and findings. 
* If time, can re-run this activity with different group formation to elicit wider range of feedback.

## Google Doc Draft Review

**Set up:**
* Students form groups of 3-4 (ideally different from prior group, to receive a wider range of feedback).
* Re-introduce Pomodoro Technique and strategy of focused work blocks combined with breaks. 
* Students: check that your proposal draft is in the correct Google folder and set permission for "editor" access.
* Demo how to create comments and "suggested edits" in Google docs (different than destructive/direct edits).

**20 minute pomodoros:**
  
During each pomodoro, read through the proposal, add suggested edits, and add questions as comments.  
  
(Focus less on spelling and grammar, more on clarity and questions.)
