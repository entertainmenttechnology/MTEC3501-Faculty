# Feedback Forum: 3 Ideas

_By Allison Berkoy._

_Note: This has been a session 4 in-class activity, following the "3 Ideas" and "Precedent Research" assignments. Students form small groups and take turns rapidly pitching their 3 ideas to the other students role playing as "clients." Encourage the "clients" to ask tough questions._

_The "clients" might role play as design directors, venture capitalists, Shark Tank panelists, MTEC professors, etc._  
  


## Loose Instructions

**Split into groups of 3-4**
 * Switch off roles for "presenter." 
 * Anyone not a "presenter" is a "client."

**Rapid Pitch: 5 minute timer**

Presenters:  
* You will be rapidly pitching your 3 ideas to a group of potential clients for funding for R+D. You have 5 minutes total for your pitch. These are very busy people.  
* Present whatever you think communicates the ideas best.
  * You can read from your short descriptions (from 3 ideas assignment).
  * You can show sketches if you have them.
  * You can discuss or show precedent research if you want to.
* As you wrap up each idea, present the current benefits and challenges that you perceive for this idea. (For example, excitement/motivation, existing skillset, need for collaborator(s), scope, cost, etc).

Clients:
* Take notes and keep track of the 3 ideas. Jot down questions you have, with particular focus on:
    * Is the idea clear?
    * Does the idea sound feasible for completion?
    * What other questions do you have about these project ideas?

**Questions: 5 minute timer**

Clients:
  * Ask questions about what you heard.   
    * You can repeat back what you heard, asking if you heard correctly, but do not give evaluative comments.
    * You are information gathering. Do not approve or reject any ideas at this point.
    * Presenters respond succinctly to each question.

**Prepare to switch: around 3 minutes**

Those who just presented:  
  *  Take a moment to jot down notes, anything that came up for you during this session.  
  
Next Presenter:
  * Prepare to present.

**Continue additional rounds until all students have presented.**

**Idea Selection**
* Look at your 3 ideas.
* Is there an idea sticking out to you that feels most exciting to work on?
* Is there an idea that seems most beneficial to your future career goals?
* Is there an idea that has a clearer vision for how you would complete it?
* If yes, circle that idea. 
* If no: (see below)

**Idea Selection Help**
* Present to the full class your ideas within 5 minutes total. 
* For each, include the pros and cons of going with these ideas. 
* Class: ask questions.  
  
**After Exercise**
* Encourage students to meet with faculty to discuss ideas if stuck.
