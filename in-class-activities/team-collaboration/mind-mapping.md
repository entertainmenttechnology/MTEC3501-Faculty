## Collaborative Mind Mapping

_Concocted by Allison Berkoy._

_Note: Introduces mind-mapping brainstorming strategy. Probably familiar to most, but a good tool to remind students of. This can be done in person on a white board or virtually on a Zoom white board. If on Zoom, take some time to show how to collaboratively work with it._

**What is a mind map?**
* It's a way of visual brainstorming, while connecting ideas to each other
* Can be done solo or in a group

**Choose a central prompt for the center of the mind map.**

**Loose Instructions:**
* Jot down all ideas and associations you have with [the central prompt], including facts, feelings, questions. Anything here is game, a collaborative dump.
* No wrong answers
* Work quickly, building off of each other's contributions

**Reflection:**
* Connect the mind-map as a useful tool for free-associating for any project, either solo or collaboratively
