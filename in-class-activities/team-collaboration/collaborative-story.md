## Collaborative Story

_Concocted by Allison Berkoy._

_Note: I sometimes open my first class with this, before we do any other kind of introduction. Good Zoom activity too. Usually goes into a whacky direction and lightens the mood. Also, it forces students to listen and pay attention! Two rounds is good for a quick activity. The more rounds, the more challenging._

**Loose instructions:**
* We will start our session with a group activity, creating a collaborative story together.
* When it is your turn, contribute a single sentence that moves the story forward. Then choose the next person to continue the story. 
* We will each contribute two sentences to the story. 
* All of us will contribute our first sentence in a first round, and then we will contribute second sentences in a second round. Meaning-- everyone in the group has contributed a first sentence before selecting anyone for a second sentence.
* The first sentences begin our story and set the stage. The final few sentences will wrap up and end the story.
* I will begin.
* “Once upon a time, there was a group of [number] students meeting online for their first day of a course called Culmination Project Development.”
