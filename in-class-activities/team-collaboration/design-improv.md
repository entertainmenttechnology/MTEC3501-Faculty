## Design Improv

_Concocted by Allison Berkoy._

_Note: I sometimes do this activity on the first day. Another team-building, listening-needing activity. Through the various rounds, students demonstrate the absurdity of real-world communication dynamics in "collaborative" environments. Probably self explanatory by the end, but it can also be a segue for further discussion and reflection for how to be a better collaborator and team contributor. Particularly for this course, it plants seeds for thinking through the dynamics of feedback and critique for student projects._

**Loose instructions:**

Intro Problem:  
* "We have a design problem to solve for. Here is the problem." 
* Explain the specific problem-- see sample problem below. 
* Then do the Brainstorming round. 
* Intro each additional round when the round before it has been completed.

Brainstorming Part 1: 
* I will set a timer for 3 minutes. Jot down as many ideas as possible. They can be really bad ideas. Don't censor yourself. Let everything come out. Only you will be looking at this, so you can write freely. 

Brainstorming Part 2:
* I will set a timer for 3 more minutes. Create a star or circle (or some other indicator) around the ideas that you find most interesting, whether good or bad, whether they will work or not. Add notes to these ideas if you think of anything else. 

"Nope" Round: 
* One person offers their idea. 
* The next person responds with, "Nope. That won't work. What I would do is..." and offers a new idea. 
* In response to the last offered idea, the next person says, "Nope. That won't work either. What I would do is..."
* And so on, until everyone has responded / offered a new idea.

"Yes, BUT" Round:
* One person offers their idea. 
* The next person responds with, "Yes, but..." and explains why it won't work. Then offers their idea.
* And so on, until everyone has gone.

The Hijack Round:  
_Optional... This is a more challenging round to do but demonstrates another common "collaborative" dynamic and can get pretty funny.... Otherwise skip to "Yes AND" round._
* One person offers their idea.
* The next person enthusiastically supports the idea. Then "hijacks" the idea and twists it so that it barely resembles the original idea anymore as they turn it into their own idea while pretending to support the first idea.  
* And so on. 

"Yes AND" Round:
* Someone shares an idea. The next person says, "Yes, and..." and builds off of that idea without modifying or negating the original idea.  
* And so on. 

**Reflection:**  
_Why did we do this ridiculous thing?_
* team building 
* collaboration
* active listening 
* group trust
* loosening rigidity around ideas
* quick brainstorms
* getting stuff out, not waiting for perfection
* reflects an iterative design process, something that is not fixed in place but grows and evolves, iterative activity, continue to work on it
* "yes and" activities-- everything valid and considered before cutting / limiting / censoring / dismissing


## Sample Design Problems:

### Building Community for MTEC Students
_I tried this one out and it elicited great, wide-ranging responses. Kept an interesting tone of trying to tackle a real problem that students are personally invested in, while managing the ridiculousness of the communication dynamics._

**The problem:**
* We are trying to build more community for MTEC students. 
* We are thinking through the way we communicate as a program and department, with more opportunities for building community online and offline.
* As faculty, we are deeply engaged in these discussions, but I think we should also be asking other experts, you as students. What are your ideas?
 
**The Challenges:** 
* We have limited funding for events, purchasing food, paying guests. 
* City Tech as a commuter school
* Impacts of Covid still reverberating
* Etc.
