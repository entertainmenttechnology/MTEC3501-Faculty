# 3 Ideas Reflection

_By Allison Berkoy._

_Note: This has been a session 3 in-class activity, following the "3 Ideas" assignment. I go down this list of questions slowly as students review their assignment._


## Loose Instructions

* Review your 3 ideas. (You will be presenting these next week, informally.) 
* Ask yourself: 
  * Do these ideas align with your concentration / experience?
  * Do these ideas meet your career goals?
  * Goals for job or grad school portfolio item?
  * Can you imagine a project stemming from this idea in which you already have about 75% of the skills? 
  * Do you want to collaborate for any of these ideas? Are there collaborators to touch base with now?
  * Do you need to meet with any faculty to advise on these ideas quickly?
  * Do these ideas lend themselves to a manageable scope?

For the next assignment (precedents research), modify your 3 ideas if not meeting the above. 

(Discuss any questions coming up, etc.)
