# Initial Idea Brainstorming

_By Allison Berkoy._

_Note: This has been my session 2 in-class activity, as a precursor for the "3 Ideas" assignment. It is geared towards Zoom in this current form but can easily be adapted for in-person._

_I tell students ahead of time to bring paper and a writing tool, to try to find a comfortable space to Zoom in from, to bring beverages and/or snacks and whatever else might help in keeping a clearer head throughout the session._  
  
_If adapting for in-person, it will be important for students to feel a sense of privacy (others not seeing what they are writing or sketching) for the activity to work well._

_The main techniques used here: a series of timed brainstorms, listing and visual mapping, and attention-switching (hence, the walk). All timers are set by the instructor, with time left announced to students at regular intervals (3 more minutes! 1 more minute! 30 seconds-- keep writing!)._

## Set Up

Briefly discuss brainstorming strategies-- how do the students currently brainstorm for ideas?

Some of the strategies we will explore include timers, listing, mind-mapping, sketching, attention-switching, and research.

I will not be collecting your brainstorms from this session. Today's process is for you. So please do not worry about others seeing whatever you put on paper. Do not censor yourself today with the ideas that come to you, whether they seem like great ideas, horrible ideas, or too complex or simple for Culmination.

What is a "mind map?"
* A technique for visual brainstorming, while connecting ideas to each other.
* Briefly show examples.

## Loose Instructions

**Stand Up and Stretch (2-3 min)**
* Stand up and stretch. 
* Movement = more oxygen to the brain = clearer thinking and a better mood. 

**What's Past is Prologue (The Tempest): 5 minute timer**
* We will dive into the past to find ideas for the future. Which courses, skills, projects, and experiences might you want to build off of for Culmination?
* Using your computer, or paper, create a list or mind map of all projects you can remember that you found interesting to work on / or were proud of.
* These can be large midterm or final projects, short assignments, or independent projects outside of class. List anything that you worked on that you MIGHT want to extend further if you have the chance to.  

**Timed Brainstorm: 5 minute timer**
* Create another list or mind map.
* Write as many ideas down as possible, as quickly as possible, for Culmination project ideas. Try to be somewhat specific (not just "game", but what kind of game), but you do not need to be super specific here. Don't censor yourself. Write down ALL ideas, even the seemingly bad ones.   
* Try to write or map for the entire 5 minutes.  

**Timed Sketching: 5 minute timer**
* Sketch out as many ideas as possible, no matter how "bad" or farfetched they might seem.
* You may add labels with words or notes, but let the sketches drive the brainstorming, even if you do not consider yourself someone who draws well.
* Try to sketch continuously for the entire 5 minutes.  

**Reflect: 5-7 minute timer**  
* Look at your list, sketches, and map (if you mapped).
* Which ideas seem promising? Circle or star those ideas.
* Are there any ideas that you might want to combine? If so, mark those too.  
* Start to list out further details for any of these ideas. 

**Take a Walk: 10 minute timer**
* Students, set a timer for 10 minutes on your phone or watch. 
* Take a walk. The walk can be outside, around your bedroom, pacing the hallway: where you go does not matter. Wherever you are, keep moving for 10 minutes.
* Notice what is around you. Notice the colors and shapes of what is around you. Notice the people, if there are any people. Pay attention to what you see, hear, smell.
* You may start to think about Culmination, but it is ok if you do not. If other thoughts come up, try to put your attention back onto what you are seeing and hearing, smelling, and feeling. But you do not need to force anything.  
* Please DO NOT pay attention to your phone, computer, or other device during this walk. Use these 10 minutes for noticing your environment. 

**Reflect: 3-5 minute timer**
* Look over your selected ideas list again.
* Add any notes / details / thoughts coming up.  
  
**Breakout Sessions: 5 minute timers / 15-20 minutes total**
* Split into groups of 3 or 4 and assign to breakout rooms.  
* Students, when it is your turn, share the most promising ideas with your group.
* Group members: ask questions about these ideas and give initial thoughts.
* Instructor: keep a timer for when each person should be sharing, and then switching, and announce via Zoom message broadcast. Give around 5 minutes for each person sharing.

**Reflect and Note: 5 minute timer** 
* Write down anything coming to mind from the breakout session: feedback you heard, questions, new thoughts.

**(Optional) Another Breakout Session: 5 minute timers / 15-20 minutes total**
* If time, and if a larger class size, do another round of idea sharing while mixing up the groups.
* Then do another 5 minutes of "Reflect and Note."

**Full Class Check-in**
* Check in on how the experience was.  
* Do all students have ideas for Culmination?    
* Does anyone want to share?


**For Students Who are Stuck**
* For students who say they do not have any promising ideas they are excited about, suggest continued brainstorming for after class such as this below....
* Set a 7 minute minute timer.
* Set addtional timers as needed, while taking breaks in between.  
* Dig further into past classes and skills: 
  * Create an inventory of classes that you have taken that may be useful for your Culmination project. Include all MTEC classes and any others that may feel relevant (can look at DegreeWorks for a reminder).
  * Next to the classes- note an inventory of skills or techniques you developed in the class.
  * Which assignments, class skills, projects are you most proud of?
