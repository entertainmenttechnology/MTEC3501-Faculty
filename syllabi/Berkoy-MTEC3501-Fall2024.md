### COURSE DESCRIPTION  

Students dedicate 3 classroom hours and 6 independent study hours per week to begin the process of producing a capstone project, suitable for use as a portfolio item in applications for graduate school or professional employment. Projects may be undertaken individually or in small groups. Students develop their ideas, research prior art, break down proposed work into a sequence of executable components with estimated times-to-completion, iterate through prototypes, and document their work. This course is a prerequisite for ENT 4501 Culmination Project, in which students finalize and present the work begun in Culmination Project Development. Ideally, students will take the two courses consecutively.   
     
  
### LEARNING OUTCOMES       
For the successful completion of this course, a student should be able to:      
* employ industry standard brainstorming techniques, both alone and in groups.  
* utilize best practices in design documentation.   
* give and receive feedback on project ideas.    
* conduct precedent and technical research for projects.    
* develop a complete project proposal.  
* demonstrate a testable prototype or proof of concept for their project.

  
## COURSE MATERIALS           
* External storage device, or cloud-based storage, for backing up your work    
* A sketchbook, or paper to sketch with (does not need to be exclusive to this class)    
* For online portion of class, you will need a computer with internet access, webcam, and microphone (either your own, or from a lab on campus). While you may join from a phone as a secondary device (using it as a flexible webcam), it is not possible to fully participate in our class solely from a phone.               
* Free software and accounts: Zoom, Discord, Google Drive      
* Headphones or earbuds (required for lab computers)              
      
## EXPECTATIONS  
By signing up for this class, you are making a **commitment to fully participate, support your classmates as best you can, and do your part in creating a positive working environment**. For our course to run smoothly, everyone must:  
* **Show up to class on time**, ready to contribute.           
* Spend around **6 additional hours a week** (outside of class) on assignments and project development. For your particular project, you may need additional time, depending on your ambition and project scope. Budget more time each week than may be needed.                  
* **Check Discord** regularly for group and private messages.

* **Seek advisement outside of class** as needed for your particular project. Sign up for professors' office hours with technical questions, proposal review, or any other topic related to your project.     
* **Push creatively and technically.** Stay open and curious.             
  
## COMMUNICATION   
* **To contact your instructor with a brief, private question or message**, send a DM (Direct Message) through Discord. This is preferred over email.

## COURSE STRUCTURE  
This course combines lecture/presentation, lab/studio, and discussion/critique. In preparation for ENT 4501 Culmination Project, you will move through iterative phases of project proposal development, including brainstorming, ideation, research, rapid prototyping, and presentation. 

You will receive robust feedback along the way from your peers, your course instructor, and additional faculty. At midterm, you will present your project proposal to a panel of faculty for feedback. At the end of the semester, you will present a prototype / proof of concept to a second panel of faculty, for additional feedback. Your are encouraged to also take advantage of faculty office hours, meeting with faculty who have expertise in particular areas of your project, for technical questions and further advisement. 

Weekly assignments will be posted to our GitHub wiki on Mondays, generally due the following Monday, to further assist your project development. This will consist of short readings and media viewings, reflections, and process documentation milestones. 

Note that our course will operate in hybrid modality, in a mix of in-person sessions and synchronous Zoom sessions. See our schedule below for the modality of each session.  


## GRADING   
**COURSE GRADING**     
Participation 20%    
Weekly assignments 25%     
Midterm proposal presentation and deliverables 25%   
Final presentation and deliverables 30%   
  
      
Participation will be graded out of 3 points:     
3 = full participation: fully present for class activity, on task, and supportive of classmates throughout the class session.   
2 = partial participation: late arrival or early departure from class activity, on task for some of the time.   
1 = minimal participation: absent from class activity for more than 30 minutes, minimally on task.    
0 = no participation.    
  
**Late policy:** Every effort must be made to turn work in on time, as it will otherwise put your project behind, while making it difficult or impossible for receiving adequate feedback. It will also impact your ability to fully engage in class activities and support your peers.  On a case by case basis, in consultation with the instructor, late deliverables may be accepted for a 10% drop in the grade for each week it is late. In certain extenuating circumstances (such as a serious emergency), the late deduction may be waved. If there is an emergency preventing your ability to work or present, please contact your professor. Panelist critiques, if missed, cannot be made up.

## COURSE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES    
In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the [Center for Student Accessibility](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/accessibility/). Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Center (phone: 718–260–5143).

## A NOTE ON CITY TECH'S COUNSELING CENTER     
The [Counseling Services Center](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/counseling/) supports the educational, emotional and career development of City Tech students by providing opportunities for skill development, counseling and referrals that address obstacles to success. The Center is currently available to students remotely and in person. For questions and appointments, contact the Center at counseling@citytech.cuny.edu or 718-260-5030.        

## INCLUSIVITY 
Part I. Name + Pronoun Usage 
This course consists of individual work and group discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.    

Part II. Inclusivity Statement
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email or Discord at any time about any issues concerning you or with any such ideas.
