## Due before class on MONDAY, 12/2    
  
_Note that we will meet IN PERSON for our remaining three classes._

### **Continue to organize** 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

  
### **Submit updated proposal for second panel review**
* **Review your most recent proposal draft** and check that all sections are complete and up to date, accurately reflecting your CURRENT project plan. Make further updates as needed. At this point, your **project timeline should be detailed with clear tasks and milestones** for project completion through the end of Spring 2025.      
* **Proofread your proposal** and run the spelling/grammar checker (find it under "tools" in the top menu). Double check that any URL links within your document work correctly.  
* **Submit your proposal as a Google doc in the "Panel-2-Deliverables" folder on Google Drive, within your individual folder**. Name the file "Panel2-[yourName]-Proposal". (For example, "Panel2-AllisonB-Proposal".)   

### **Submit prototype deliverables for second panel review**
* **Submit prototype / proof of concept deliverables** to the same Google Drive folder, organizing your materials for clear and easy review by the panelists. Check in with me if you do not yet have a clear plan for what to submit. Name each file "Panel2-[yourName]-Prototype-[fileNumber]", numbering the files in the order you want for them to be reviewed. (For example, "Panel2-AllisonB-Prototype-01" and "Panel2-AllisonB-Prototype-02")     

### **Submit prototype / work in progress summary for second panel review**
* **Submit a written summary of your prototype and work in progress** to the same Google Drive folder. Describe your work and process in creating your prototype, and any surprises, roadblocks, and/or modifications to your project plan based on this work. Include a summary of the files that you have submitted and how they relate to your overall project. If you are submitting a playtest, include any instructions for how to run the playtest at the top of your summary. Name your summary file "Panel2-[yourName]-Prototype-Summary" (for example, "Panel2-AllisonB-Prototype-Summary"). 

### **Prepare a 10 minute presentation on your updated proposal and prototype / proof of concept**
* **Consider the feedback you received from panel 1**: use concise text, an organized presentation structure, images, and other multimedia to support your ideas where possible. Use your prior presentation, and your updated written project proposal, as roadmaps to work from. 
* **Consider the time constraints** when preparing your presentation. The panelists will need a clear overview of your proposal, prototype, and future work plan. Keep in mind that they will also be reviewing the materials you submit to the Drive, where you can include more detail.
* **The main goal for this presentation** is to communicate your project idea and work in progress as best as possible, so that you can receive the most useful feedback possible. If there is particular feedback that you would like from the panelists, I suggest including your questions directly into the presentation.    
* **Practice your presentation** and make sure the timing is under 10 minutes.    
* **Submit your presentation slides as a PDF** to your Google Drive folder. Name the file "Panel2-[yourName]-Presentation". (For example, "Panel2-AllisonB-Presentation")  
  
_**Note that everyone needs to submit materials before class on 12/2**, regardless of which day you might present on._  
  
## Some general FAQ to keep in mind as you prepare your materials....       
* **There will be a brief Q+A** following your presentation.  
* **Each panelist will submit a feedback form** after reviewing your presentation and materials, which will go to me and to you. 
* **Remember: you're not alone in this process!** Use our Discord space for any questions coming up as you prep for the panels.
