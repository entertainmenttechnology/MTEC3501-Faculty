## Due before class on Monday, 12/9   
  
_Note that we will meet IN PERSON for all remaining classes._

### **Continue to organize** 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

### **Peer Feedback** 
* **For EACH student who presented on 12.2, write a brief feedback summary** in response to their presentation. This can be in paragraph form or written as bullet points. Include the following: 
    * Which parts of the presentation felt particularly strong, communicating the proposal and prototype progress effectively?
    * Which parts of the presentation felt confusing or less than clear?  
    * What lingering questions do you currently have about the presenter's project proposal or prototype?  
    * Any other comments that you think could be helpful for the presenter?  

* **If you were not present for the presentations**, please review each presenter's final deliverables in the "Panel-2-Deliverables" folder, and give feedback on the documents instead of the presentation.  

* **Submit your feedback for each student on Google Drive.** In our class folder, find the subfolder **"Peer-Feedback-Panel-2"**, which contains subfolders of each student's name. (Do not submit to the Panel-2-Deliverables folder, which is for faculty panel review only.) Label your document "Session13-[yourName]-feedback-for-[studentName]" (for example "Session13-AllisonB-feedback-for-Sam").
