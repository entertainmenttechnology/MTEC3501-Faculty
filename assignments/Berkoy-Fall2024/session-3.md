## Due before our next class on MONDAY, 9/30  
  
_Note that our next class in in person._

### **Continue to organize** 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

  
### **Researching 3 Ideas**
* **Return to the 3 potential ideas** you submitted for the session 2 assignment. Review your brainstorming notes, sketches, and summaries for each idea. Continue to add to these notes and sketches as additional thoughts and questions pop up.   
* **Preliminary precedent research:** For each idea, begin to research other projects out in the world that overlap with your own idea in some way. Look for projects with technical, conceptual, and/or aesthetic overlaps. For example, if your idea is a body-controlled game on the theme of climate change, you might research other body-controlled games, different types of sensors and systems related to body-controlled interaction, existing games related to climate change, etc. Identify at least 3 precedent projects that relate to EACH idea (for 9 precedent examples in total).    
* **Submit three PDFs to me via Discord, one for each of the three ideas, with the following included in each separate PDF:**  
  * Idea number and a preliminary name for your idea (this can be generic, like "Idea #1: Body-controlled Game about Climate Change". We just want a way of identifying each idea for now.)   
  * A brief summary of your idea in a few sentences (you can take this directly from the session 2 assignment).    
  * 3 precedent projects, including the following:  
     * Name of the precedent project and creator(s) of the project.  
     * URL weblink or other citation for the project.  
     * Documentation of the project- through images, audio, and/or video. Choose documentation that most clearly represents the project you are referencing.     
     * A brief description of the precedent project, in 1-3 sentences.
     * A brief description of how this precedent relates to your project idea AND how this precedent differs from your idea.   

* **Submit each PDF to me via Discord**. Name each file "Session3_[yourName]_Precedents_[idea #]". (For example, "Session3_AllisonB_Precedents_Idea2")
