## Due before class on Monday, 10/28    
  
_Note that we will meet IN PERSON for our next class on 10/28_

### **Continue to organize** 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

### **Peer Feedback** 
* **For EACH student who presented on 10.21 (Sen, Jason, Nate, and Eddie), write a brief feedback summary** in response to their presentation. Include the following: 
    * Which parts of the presentation felt particularly strong, communicating the proposal ideas effectively?
    * Which parts of the presentation felt confusing or less than clear?
    * What lingering questions do you currently have about the presenter's project proposal?  
    * Any other comments that you think could be helpful for the presenter?  

* **If you were not present for the presentations**, please review their final deliverables in the "Panel-1-Deliverables" folder, and give feedback on the documents instead of the presentation.  

* **Submit your feedback for each student on Google Drive.** In our class folder, find the subfolder **"Peer-Feedback-Panel-1"**, which contains subfolders of each student's name. (Do not submit to the Panel-1-Deliverables folder, which is for faculty panel review only.) Label your document "Session7-[yourName]-feedback-for-[studentName]" (for example "Session7-AllisonB-feedback-for-Sam").  

### **Reflect** 
* We are now about halfway through this course and semester. **Reflect on your time management strategies for this semester so far.** Reflect on how well you have been able to balance your schoolwork, your outside commitments, rest, and downtime. Which strategies have been working well for you? Which strategies or habits might you want to change? What tips might you have for other students struggling with time management and school/life balance?    
* **Submit your reflection to me as a PDF via DM on Discord** and label the file "Session7-[yourName]-Reflect" (e.g. "Session7-AllisonB-Reflect").
