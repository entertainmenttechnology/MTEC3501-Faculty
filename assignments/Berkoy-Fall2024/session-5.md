## Due before class on TUESDAY, 10/15  
  
_Note that we will meet ON ZOOM on 10/15, which is on a Monday schedule._   
_The college is closed on 10/14._  

### **Continue to organize** 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

  
### **Complete a revised draft proposal for your selected idea**
* **Create a copy of your proposal draft**, leaving the first version intact.   
* **Review questions and suggestions** from myself and your peers from our prior class session.  
* **Modify and clarify proposal sections** as needed. If any sections were incomplete, now is the time to complete them.     
* **Proofread your proposal** and run the spelling/grammar checker (find it under "tools" in the top menu). Double check that any URL links within your document work correctly.  
* **Submit your revised proposal as a Google doc in our shared Google Drive folder, within your individual folder** (check Discord for folder link and more info). Name the file "[yourName]_Proposal-v2". (For example, "AllisonB_Proposal-v2")     

  
### **Continue to reach out to potential collaborators and for faculty feedback as needed**
* **If you are seeking core collaborators** for your project idea, you should now have these collaborations confirmed.    
* **If you are seeking contributions from others with a smaller scope** (for example, music contribution for a game, a small number of illustrations or assets, etc), confirm your contributors this week, or send me your pitches to submit to MTEC, ENT, and/or COMD students more broadly.
* **If you have technical questions and/or can use more guidance about any of your ideas**, email faculty aligned with your project area with quick questions, or make appointments with faculty during their office hours for longer discussions.
