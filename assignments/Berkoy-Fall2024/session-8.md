## Due before class on Monday, 11/4    
  
_Note that we will meet ON ZOOM for our next class on 11/4_

### **Continue to organize** 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

### **Peer Feedback** 
* **For EACH student who presented on 10.28 (Bruce, Hugo, Osak, Peter, and Jay), write a brief feedback summary** in response to their presentation. Include the following: 
    * Which parts of the presentation felt particularly strong, communicating the proposal ideas effectively?
    * Which parts of the presentation felt confusing or less than clear?
    * What lingering questions do you currently have about the presenter's project proposal?  
    * Any other comments that you think could be helpful for the presenter?  

* **If you were not present for the presentations**, please review their final deliverables in the "Panel-1-Deliverables" folder, and give feedback on the documents instead of the presentation.  

* **Submit your feedback for each student on Google Drive.** In our class folder, find the subfolder **"Peer-Feedback-Panel-1"**, which contains subfolders of each student's name. (Do not submit to the Panel-1-Deliverables folder, which is for faculty panel review only.) Label your document "Session8-[yourName]-feedback-for-[studentName]" (for example "Session8-AllisonB-feedback-for-Sam").  

### **Reflect** 
* **Review all of the feedback that you have received** on your written proposal and presentation so far, including feedback from your peers, myself, and the faculty panelists (their questions after your presentation, and their feedback forms if you have received them by this point). You may not have all of the written feedback yet, so just review what you have so far. Summarize the feedback you have received, where you agree or disagree, and how the feedback might be reflected in the next proposal revision that you work on. Which areas of your proposal do you  think you need to clarify, expand upon, and/or modify? Any other takeaways that you have from the feedback so far?      
* **Submit your reflection to me as a PDF via DM on Discord** and label the file "Session8-[yourName]-Reflect" (e.g. "Session8-AllisonB-Reflect").
