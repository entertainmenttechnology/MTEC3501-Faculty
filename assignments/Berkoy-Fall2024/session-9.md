## Due before class on Monday, 11/11    
  
_Note that we will meet ON ZOOM for our next class on 11/11_

### **Continue to organize**. 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

### **Review feedback**.
* Review all feedback that you have received from faculty and peers through this point.  

### **Update and expand the testable prototype / proof of concept section of your proposal.** Include the following: 
* a **description** of the prototype / proof of concept (what is it?).
* clear **deliverables** (what will you be submitting, and in what format?). If it is time-based, what time length are you targeting?  
* your **process** for creating the prototype (explain it to me like I am a 10 year old and do not understand the tools or lingo. How will you go about making this?).
* a **detailed timeline** of major tasks and prototype milestones (including research, tutorials, testing, advisor meetings, etc). As a reminder, your prototype deliverables will be due on 12/2 when panel 2 presentations begin. You will need to show work-in-progress for your prototype in the two weeks leading up to the presentations, on 11/18 and 11/25.   

### **Update your proposal in full**
* **Update your proposal**- further detailing, clarifying, and modifying it- based on the feedback from faculty panelists and peers. 
* **Every section of the proposal template must be complete.** Check the **[proposal template](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Berkoy-MTEC3501-Fall2024/wiki/Proposal-Template)** to double check that you are not missing anything.        
* **Consider using the [pomodoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l4w7uHdNaQ)** while you work on your draft.   
* **Submit the completed proposal as a Google doc within your individual folder in the "Working-Drafts" Google Drive folder**. Name the file "Session9-[yourName]-Proposal". (For example, "Session9-AllisonB-Proposal")
