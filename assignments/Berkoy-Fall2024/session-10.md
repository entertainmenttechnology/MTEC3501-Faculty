## Due before class on Monday, 11/18     
  
_Note that we will meet IN PERSON for our next class on 11/18_

### **Continue to organize**. 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

### **Work on your prototype / proof of concept**.  
* Following the roadmap you have laid out for yourself in your proposal, **complete your first work in progress milestone** for your prototype / proof of concept. If you do not yet have a solid plan for this, make immediate plans for meeting with an appropriate advisor, and submit an updated plan to me.   
  
### **Submit Prototype WIP 1 deliverables**.  
* **Write up a summary of the work you completed for this first prototype milestone.** Please make sure that your write up is clear and straight forward for any outsider to understand. Check it for spelling and grammar before submitting. Include the following:  
    * Which tasks did you work on this week, and what was your process?   
    * Did you meet the original goals you had set out for yourself in your proposal calendar for this week?   
    * Did you run up against any challenges, surprises, or unanticipated outcomes with this week's work? Please describe.      
    * What will you work on in the following week, for Prototype WIP 2 (due 11/25)?  
* **Save your completed summary as a Google doc called "Session10-[yourName]-WIP1"** (for example, "Session10-AllisonB-WIP1").
* **Create a new folder called "Session10-WIP-1"** and place it within your individual folder in the "working-drafts" folder on Google Drive. Submit your summary into this newly created folder.  
* **Submit documentation of your work in progress** into your newly created folder through photos, video, code, and/or other documents.
