## Due before our next class on Monday, 9/23  
  
_Note that our next class is in person in V103B_

### **Continue to organize** 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. Account for your classes, travel, study time, outside commitments, and necessary downtime.   
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.  

### **Prepare Your "Show and Tell Presentation"**    
* **Prepare a presentation of about 10 minutes, highlighting past projects** that you are most proud of. You can show us individual or group projects, class assignments, and/or projects that you have worked on from outside of City Tech. They can be "complete" projects or work in progress. If there are any past projects that you might want to work on further for Culmination, definitely include them here. 
* 10 minutes will go by quickly. **Choose a minimum of 2 projects, a maximum of 5.** Present images, video documentation, sound-- whatever you think will best convey the projects to us. I suggest putting together a slide deck for your presentation, using Google Slides, PowerPoint, Keynote, Canva, or another platform of your choosing. This will help streamline and organize your presentation, with fewer delays as you switch between projects.  
* We have **two main goals** for these presentations: 1.) to help familiarize us with your work, so we can better support you in your Culmination proposal development, and 2.) to give you practice in presenting to the group before the panel presentations later in the semester. Keep these goals in mind as you prep these presentations, so you can get the most out of them.  
* **Check our syllabus schedule** to see if you are in group A (presenting in our next class) or group B (presenting in the following one) 

  
### **3 Ideas**
* Building off of our in-class brainstorming session, continue to **detail out 3 potential ideas** for your Culmination Project with further writing and sketching. It is okay for this phase of documentation to be messy. After you feel you have exhausted the detailing for each project (for now), summarize your 3 ideas as clearly as you can in 3-5 sentences each.   
* **Submit a PDF to me via Discord**, with your 3 ideas and written summaries for each one. Name the file "Session2_[yourName]_3Ideas".
