## Due before class on MONDAY, 10/21    
  
_Note that we will meet IN PERSON for our next two classes on 10/21 + 10/28_

### **Continue to organize** 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

  
### **Complete a revised draft proposal for your selected idea**
* **Review questions and suggestions** from myself and your peers as you iterate on your next proposal draft.  
* **Modify and clarify proposal sections** as needed. All sections must be complete to receive a green light on your proposal. 
* **Proofread your proposal** and run the spelling/grammar checker (find it under "tools" in the top menu). Double check that any URL links within your document work correctly.  
* **Submit a "clean copy" of your revised proposal to the "Panel-1-Deliverables" folder in our class Google Drive, within your individual folder** (check Discord for folder link and more info). By "clean copy", I mean that this version should not have any outstanding comments or edit suggestions. Keep it in Google doc format and name the file "Panel1-[yourName]-Proposal". (For example, "Panel1-AllisonB-Proposal").    

### **Prepare a 10 minute presentation on your proposal idea**
* **Consider what worked well from the show + tell presentations**: use concise text, an organized presentation structure, images, and other multimedia to support your ideas where possible. Use your written project proposal as a roadmap to work from. 
* **Use precedent research and/or brief examples of your past work** to help bolster your proposal. For example, if you are proposing a game, include brief examples of your past game projects. If you are proposing an animation project, shows us some of your past animation work. This will help the panelists understand the past experiences you are building from, for easier assessment of your proposal and its feasibility.      
* **We have one main goal for this presentation**: to communicate your project idea as best as possible, so that you can receive the most useful feedback possible. It is understood that this proposal will continue to evolve, and it is okay to point out areas where you are feeling more uncertain (and where you could potentially use more feedback). However, we do expect for your proposal to be well prepared and researched, with a preliminary production plan that appears reasonable. If your proposal is incomplete, or too vague in how you will execute your project, the panel cannot green light it.       
* **Practice your presentation** and make sure the timing is under 10 minutes.    
* **Submit your presentation slides as a PDF** to your Google Drive subfolder within the "Panel-1-Deliverables" folder. Name the file "Panel1-[yourName]-Presentation". (For example, "Panel1-AllisonB-Presentation") 
  
_**Note that everyone needs to submit materials before class on 10/21**, regardless of which day you might present on._  
  
## Some general FAQ to keep in mind as you prepare your materials....     
* **Panelists will review your written proposal**, in addition to viewing your presentation. You do not need to cram every detail from your proposal into your presentation-- stick to the most important points.   
* **There will be a brief Q+A of about 5 minutes** following your presentation.  
* **Each panelist will submit a feedback form** after reviewing your presentation and written proposal, which will go to me and to you. You can [preview the feedback form here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mwz4ev9sjlcfv7ruqekkw/Panel-1-Feedback-Form-preview.pdf?rlkey=basv5665odvjpnzu61545q3gx&dl=0) to see the areas that the panelists will be most focused on.    
* **Remember: you're not alone in this process!** Use our Discord space for any questions coming up as you prep for the panels.
