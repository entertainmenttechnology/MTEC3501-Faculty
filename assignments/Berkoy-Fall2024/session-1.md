## Due before our next class on Monday, 9/16

### **Organize** 
* **Join our Discord channel** if you have not already done so. If you did not receive an invitation, email me at allison.berkoy48@citytech.cuny.edu . 
* **[Review our syllabus](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Berkoy-MTEC3501-fall2024/wiki/)** and familiarize yourself with the plan and protocols. If you have questions, please send me a DM on Discord.    
* **Set up a time management system:**   
    * If you do not already have a calendar system that works well for you, I recommend **selecting a digital calendar** where you can easily edit events and tasks and shift them around. Ideally, look at cloud-based systems that can be accessed from anywhere and synch across multiple devices. Popular free calendars include: [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar), [Microsoft Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/welcome-to-your-outlook-calendar-6fb9225d-9f9d-456d-8c81-8437bfcd3ebf), and [Apple Calendar with iCloud](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/use-calendar-on-icloudcom-mmd67283e4/icloud) (can be used with PC devices as well as Apple).      
    * **Organize your semester.** Create time blocks for all of your classes, including travel, and anticipated time needed for assignments. Block out **6 hours each week** for assignments for this class. Create time blocks for other known commitments: regular appointments, work schedule, etc.. Color coding different types of activities can be helpful here. After organizing, look at your calendar. Do you have enough free time? Downtime? Time for eating lunch? If not, look for ways to restructure your schedule. If this is feeling way too challenging, book an appointment with me or with the [counseling center](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/counseling/) for help with time management strategies. Having a plan and schedule (even if you can't always follow it) will help immensely as you start to organize for your Culmination project.

### **Watch**
* **[Access past Culmination presentations here.](https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/ent4499fa2022-sp2023/past-selected-presentation-videos/)**    
* **Watch at least 3 individual presentations**, running around 10-15 minutes each, selecting any presentations from any year in which documentation exists. I recommend scrolling through them a bit first, finding presentations that feel most relevant to your area of interest.

  
### **Reflect**
* **Write a two-part reflection** responding to the following prompts and questions below. These are informal writings, but they should be checked for typos, grammar, and general clarity before submitting. All questions must be answered for full credit.
* **To submit:** Save your reflection as a PDF and label the file "Session1_[firstName]_Reflect" (e.g. "Session1_Allison_Reflect"). Submit it to me via DM on Discord before our next class.

   * What calendar system have you chosen for this class and semester? Is this calendar system new to you? What is your experience like with it so far?  
   * Thinking beyond yourself now, what tips would you suggest to other students in this class for time-management? 

Part 2: Past Culmination Projects:
