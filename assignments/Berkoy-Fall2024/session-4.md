## Due before class on Monday, 10/7  
  
_Note that we will meet on ZOOM for our next class on 10/7._ 

### **Continue to organize** 
* At the top of each week, **make a plan for the week ahead using your calendar system**. 
* **Continue to assess your calendar system and time management strategies** and how well they are working for you. Keep what is working. Try something new (or try the same technique in a different way) for what is not working.   

  
### **Select 1 idea**
* **Review your 3 ideas**, including all notes, brainstorming details, sketches, research, and class discussions. 
* **Assess the following:** Which idea sticks out to you as the most exciting to work on? Which idea seems most beneficial for your career goals? Which idea has a clear vision for completion and feasibility? Select the idea that overall feels like the winner.     
* **If you are stuck and cannot decide**, continue to talk out your ideas with your peers, myself, and/or make an appointment with another faculty member for advisement.   
* **SAVE all notes**, brainstorms, sketches, etc. for all of your ideas. You may wish to go back to one of them in the future.  

### **Complete a draft proposal for your selected idea**
* **Complete a full proposal** using the **[proposal template](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Berkoy-MTEC3501-Fall2024/wiki/Proposal-Template)**.   
* **Allocate enough time for completing the proposal**: it should take several hours to complete.  
* **Keep in mind this motto: ["finished not perfect"](https://youtu.be/lRtV-ugIT0k?si=w7rZNNYpGjXd0_dg).** It is understood that the proposal is a draft and will change throughout the semester. Try to not get too stuck on perfect plans or perfect answers for now. The way to complete this assignment "perfectly" is simply to thoughtfully complete it in full, to the best of your ability right now. This will allow us to thoroughly workshop your idea next week, giving you time to think more and iterate on the proposal, while preparing for more feedback from the faculty panel in the following week.   
* **Consider using the [pomodoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l4w7uHdNaQ)** while you work on your draft.   
* **Submit the completed proposal as a Google doc in our shared Google Drive folder** (check Discord for folder link and more info). Name the file "Session4_[yourName]_Proposal". (For example, "Session4_AllisonB_Proposal")   
  
### **Reach out to potential collaborators and for faculty feedback as needed**
* **If you are seeking core collaborators** for your project idea, reach out now (if you have not already done so). Get confirmation within the week of interest and commitment. If you are unable to find collaborators, reduce the scope of your project to complete on your own, or pivot to another idea.      
* **If you are seeking contributions from others with a smaller scope** (for example, music contribution for a game, a small number of illustrations or assets, etc), reach out now and/or write up what you are looking for and we can send your pitches to MTEC, ENT, and COMD students more broadly.
* **If you have technical questions and/or can use more guidance about any of your ideas**, now is the time to make appointments with faculty during their office hours.
