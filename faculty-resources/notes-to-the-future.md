## Notes from AB on SP24 and FA24 sections

**What students reported as class strengths:**
* Iterative project milestones.  
* Panel feedback.
* Regular peer feedback.  
* Early brainstorming activities.  
* 3 ideas process (not getting stuck on one idea early on).
* Team-building activities.
* Introduction of pomodoro technique / using it in class.  
 

**What students reported as potential improvement areas / things to consider:**
  * About half the class suggested more time spent on **time management strategies** (project management and scheduling strategies, helpful apps, etc.). About half the class did not feel they needed this.
  * Some students suggested either requiring or strongly encouraging that they **meet with an advisor after going through the "3 ideas" process**, before getting deep into the proposal on a single idea. There are logistical challenges with this due to the tight time frame. But something to think about. In the past requiring advisement meetings tended to not work well.   
  * The majority of students requested **more feedback on their project deliverables from panelists** (proposals, prototype documentation, etc). 
 

**More thoughts from AB...**
* In the past two sections, **there have been no collaborations**, though they have been encouraged from the outset. I am unsure if this is simply the preference of the cohorts or if something in the process needs to change to further support collaborative projects.
* Students **tend to find value in the iterative process retroactively**, while finding it tedious and a bit strange while going through it. 
* As much as possible, it helps to **connect the process to real-world practices**. I try to emphasize that these are not just random assignments but reflect processes in the real world: pitching ideas  to a client or internal team, precedent research for project pitches, making a pitch deck,  working with a team to iterate on designs, bringing a project through multiple design phases, etc. 
* **Set up clear course expectations from day 1:** This is all in the syllabus, but it needs to be emphasized and repeated: 
  * **Budget around 6 hours weekly for assignments** outside of class time. In-class time is shorter compared to other MTEC 3-credit courses, to account for increased homework time. 
  * **Designated writing intensive course.** They will write! It counts towards the 4 WI requirements.
  * **Year long process.** This is a two-course sequence.  
* **Are all students planning to graduate next semester?** Some students are signing up too early. Try to catch this on the first day.   
* **Students struggle to make a clear production timeline.** The proposal template likely needs tweaking to make task and milestone breakdowns across both semesters more explicit. I suggest providing example timelines and adding more in-class time for assessing timeline drafts. I emphasize that the timeline is not meant to be rigid but an evolving plan. 
* **Hybrid set up worked ok.** In both sections we were in person for about 60% of classes, with panels in person, and the last month fully in person. Both classes generally reported liking the hybrid set up. 
* **We need a plan for documenting MTEC Culmination projects.** The first assignment points students to online project presentations before 3501 was implemented. They generally find this helpful, but MTEC faculty should discuss an archive strategy for providing newer resources.
